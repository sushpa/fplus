# type matching : func checkArgTypes

# 1
# set each exprs typeType & collectionType.
# 8b type, 8b colltype, 16b dims. can just struct them & do == on int32

# 2
# have a func checkArgTypes that takes astexpr* a,b
# for leaf kinds, compares their type & errors on mismatch.
# for comma, recurs with a->right and b->right, then a->left and b->left
# this could be used later to check subscript index types.

# func setExprType: recurs into nonterminals, sets their typpes from the leaves upwards.

# func checkOpTypes: checks a->left and a-> right for mismatch, recursively.
