# Jet

A modern, simple language with all the features you need for scientific computing. Fast multidimensional arrays with slicing syntax, simple modular program structure, powerful assertions and implied contracts, and in-depth compile-time analysis for all major classes of bugs.

- No pointers, no null. Variables are always initalized.
- Static and strong typing, but writing code almost feels like a dynamically typed language.
- No runtime errors for out-of-bounds access, null object access, zero division, or stack overflows.
- Array notation that you know and love from Fortran 90, MATLAB, numpy, Julia.
- Blazing fast compiler as well as language builtins and standard library routines.

Jet is in active development. While it can compile simple programs, not all features are implemented yet.
